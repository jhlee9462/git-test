It barks at no one else
But me
Like it's seen
A ghost
I guess it's seen the sparks
A-flowin'
No one else
Would know

Hey man, slow down
Slow down
Idiot, slow down
Slow down

Sometimes I get overcharged
That's when you
See sparks
They ask me where the hell
I'm going?
At a thousand feet per second

Hey man, slow down
Slow down
Idiot, slow down
Slow down

Hey man, slow down
Slow down
Idiot, slow down
Slow down
