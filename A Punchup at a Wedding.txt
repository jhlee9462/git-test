I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there, It wasn't like that
You've come here just to start a fight

You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a durnken punchup at a weddin, yeah

Hypocrite, opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn round, you stay frozen to the spot

The pointless snide remarks
Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a durnken punchup at a wedding, yeah
